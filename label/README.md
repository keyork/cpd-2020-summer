[Manually verified LFW gender labels](http://bit.ly/lfw-gender), from:

"In order to label the images based on gender, we used the attribute values presented by Kumar et al. [1]. Then, we used the genderize.io API to estimate the gender based on the first name of each face image in the LFW. Eventually, we manually reviewed each category of male and female images three times to completely eliminate any incorrect labels.
